# Options Trading: Technical Analysis Notes

A collection of technical analysis patterns and strategies specifically adapted for options trading in volatile market conditions.

## Key Technical Indicators for Options

### Moving Averages
- **20-day EMA**: Short-term trend direction
- **50-day SMA**: Medium-term support/resistance
- **200-day SMA**: Long-term trend confirmation

### Volatility Indicators
- **VIX**: Market fear gauge, crucial for options pricing
- **Bollinger Bands**: Volatility expansion/contraction
- **ATR**: Average True Range for position sizing

## Options-Specific Patterns

### Volatility Squeeze
When Bollinger Bands contract while VIX remains elevated, expect a significant move. This creates opportunities for:
- Straddle strategies
- Strangle positions
- Iron condors

### Support/Resistance Levels
Key levels become more significant for options:
- **Strike price clustering**: Areas with high open interest
- **Psychological levels**: Round numbers (100, 50, 25)
- **Previous highs/lows**: Historical significance

## Risk Management Principles

### Position Sizing
- Never risk more than 2% of portfolio on a single trade
- Use the Greeks to understand risk exposure
- Consider correlation between positions

### Time Decay Management
- Avoid buying options with <30 days to expiration
- Consider selling premium in high IV environments
- Use calendar spreads to benefit from time decay

## Market Regime Adaptation

### Trending Markets
- Favor directional strategies
- Use momentum indicators
- Consider trend-following options strategies

### Range-Bound Markets
- Focus on volatility strategies
- Use mean reversion indicators
- Implement income-generating strategies

## Key Takeaways

1. **Volatility is your friend**: Options thrive on volatility
2. **Time is your enemy**: Always consider time decay
3. **Risk management is paramount**: Protect capital above all
4. **Adapt to market conditions**: No single strategy works in all environments

Remember: Options trading requires discipline, patience, and continuous learning. Start small, learn from mistakes, and gradually increase position sizes as you gain experience.
