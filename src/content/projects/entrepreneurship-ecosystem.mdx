# Entrepreneurship Ecosystem

## Outcome

Immersive exposure to venture ecosystems and hands-on startup building through workshops, MVP projects, and pitch events.

## Context

Part of my ongoing work to understand how ideas scale from prototype to market—combining product thinking, venture analysis, and execution.

## What I did

- Selected for the Silicon Valley Entrepreneurship Workshop through UIUC, visiting startups and alumni-led companies such as C3.ai and AmpUp.
- Private dinner with Steve Chen, YouTube Co-Founder, during the University's TEC event—discussed product timing, market intuition, and founder mindset.
- Active in pitch competitions and hackathons, building and testing MVPs focused on automation, productivity, and digital infrastructure.
- Continuously exploring early-stage idea validation, go-to-market design, and business model testing.
