# Macroeconomic Forecasting Report

## Outcome

Built a global forecasting system with 20 falsifiable predictions and causal models to map how modern mercantilism will shape trade, energy, and fiscal and monetary policy.

## Context

Part of the Bridgewater x Global Citizen Forecasting the Future Challenge. Explored how nations use debt, data, and industrial strategy to secure power in a post-globalization world.

## What I did

- Created a repeatable forecasting template linking probabilities, timeframes, and cause-effect chains.
- Produced 20 predictions across education, AI, energy, fiscal dynamics, and currency competition.
- Synthesized insights into a "competitive sovereignty" thesis on the global shift from open markets to state-led advantage.

## Artifacts

- Forecast matrix [CSV]
- Causal loop visualization [image]
- Executive summary [PDF]

## Results

- Framework recognized for analytical rigor and clarity.
- Established calibration baseline for future forecast testing.

## Notes

Methodology: Bridgewater-style probabilistic reasoning with focus on falsifiability and system-level cause mapping. Role: Research and systems design lead.
